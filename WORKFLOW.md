# Git Workflow & Project Milestones

## Branching Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `development` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes for production

## Feature Branches Naming Convention
- `feature/user-registration`
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `feature/petition-creation`
- `feature/petition-signing`
- `feature/committee-dashboard`
- `feature/api-endpoints`
- `feature/qr-scanner`

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- refactor: Code refactoring
- test: Adding tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

Example:
```

## Commit Checkpoint Guidelines

1. **Feature Start**
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

2. **During Development**
   - Commit when you:
     - Complete a logical unit of work
     - Add a new function/component
     - Fix a bug
     - Add tests
     - Update documentation

3. **Before Merging**
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   git checkout feature/feature-name
   git rebase development
   git push origin feature/feature-name
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**
   - Title: Clear description of the feature
   - Description: 
     - What was implemented
     - How to test
     - Related issues
